# Specification Quality Checklist: TapLog Development Environment and Android Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — exception: the user explicitly requests approved Android build and SDK foundation details.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic where applicable; required build-foundation constraints are stated only because they are in scope.
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No unrequested implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1: The only open decisions were resolved with the conservative current stable Android 16/API 36 baseline, JDK 17, and the repository-owner-backed `io.github.thrhead.taplog` identifier. All checklist items now pass.
